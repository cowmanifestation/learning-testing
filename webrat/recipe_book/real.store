Well,"This seems OK so far...."Thai Coconut Rice"Ingredients

    * 1/2 tsp. coconut oil shopping list
    * 2 cups Thai jasmine white rice shopping list
    * 1 can coconut milk shopping list
    * 1 3/4 cups water shopping list
    * 1/2 tsp. salt shopping list
    * 1 tsp. palm sugar or brown sugar shopping list

How to make it

    * Coat the inside of the pot with oil
    * Add rice, coconut milk, water, and salt to the pot. Place pot on the stove over medium high heat. Stir well.
    * Add the sugar and continue to stir (to keep the rice from sticking to the pot) until the mixture comes to a gentle boil.
    * Once the coconut-water has begun to bubble, stop stirring. Turn down the heat to low. Place lid askew on the pot, so that it is at least 3/4 covered.
    * Allow rice to cook in this way for 15-20 minutes, or until rice has absorbed most of the coconut-water.
    * turn off the heat, but leave the pot on the burner. Cover the pot tightly with the lid and allow to sit 5-10 minutes, or until ready to serve.
    * Fluff the rice before serving
